        <h3>How It Works</h3>

        <h4>Step 1: Upload Your Image</h4>
        <p>Start by uploading your image to the platform. We support multiple image formats such as
            <strong>JPEG</strong>, <strong>PNG</strong>, <strong>GIF</strong>, <strong>TIFF</strong>, and
            <strong>WebP</strong>. No need for any complicated software installation.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 2: Choose Your Desired Format</h4>
        <p>Select from a wide range of formats for conversion, including <strong>WebP to PNG</strong>, <strong>JPEG to
                WebP</strong>, <strong>TIFF to JPEG</strong>, and many others. Whether you need a <strong>transparent
                PNG</strong>, or a <strong>WebP with a transparent background</strong>, we have you covered!</p>

        <h4>Step 3: Convert & Download</h4>
        <p>Once your image is uploaded and the format selected, the conversion process begins. During conversion, you’ll
            see a loading animation to let you know everything is processing smoothly. Once the conversion is complete,
            your image will be ready for download. Click the download button to save the image to your device in the
            chosen format.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>

        <h4>1. How do I convert WebP to JPG?</h4>
        <p>To convert <strong>WebP to JPG</strong>, simply upload your WebP image to our tool, select
            <strong>JPG</strong> as the output format, and click <strong>Convert</strong>. Your image will be ready to
            download in just a few seconds.
        </p>

        <h4>2. How to convert WebP to PNG with transparency?</h4>
        <p>Converting <strong>WebP to PNG with transparency</strong> is simple! Just upload your WebP file and select
            <strong>PNG</strong> as the format. Our tool will maintain any transparency from your original image.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Can I convert a batch of images from PNG to WebP at once?</h4>
        <p>Yes, our platform supports <strong>bulk image conversion</strong>! You can easily convert multiple
            <strong>PNG to WebP</strong> or <strong>JPEG to PNG</strong> images in one go. Upload all the images, select
            your desired output format, and click <strong>Convert</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>4. How do I convert JPEG to PNG on Windows 10?</h4>
        <p>If you need to convert <strong>JPEG to PNG on Windows 10</strong>, simply upload your <strong>JPEG
                image</strong>, choose <strong>PNG</strong> as the format, and hit <strong>Convert</strong>. The
            converted image will be ready to download almost instantly.</p>

        <h4>5. What is the difference between WebP and JPG?</h4>
        <p>WebP is a modern image format developed by Google, offering smaller file sizes while maintaining high image
            quality. JPG, on the other hand, is an older format that may not provide the same level of compression
            efficiency as WebP. Use <strong>WebP</strong> for web usage when you want faster load times, but for general
            use and compatibility, <strong>JPG</strong> is still widely used.</p>

        <h4>6. Can I convert an image with a transparent background?</h4>
        <p>Yes! We support <strong>converting WebP to PNG with transparent background</strong> and other similar
            formats. Our tool ensures your images retain their transparency during the conversion process.</p>

        <h4>7. How to convert PNG to JPG with a white background?</h4>
        <p>To convert <strong>PNG to JPG with a white background</strong>, simply upload your <strong>PNG image</strong>
            and select <strong>JPG</strong> as your desired format. If your PNG has a transparent background, we will
            fill it with white automatically.</p>

        <h4>8. Is this tool free to use?</h4>
        <p>Yes, <strong>quickconverter</strong> is completely free. There are no hidden charges. Convert as many images
            as you need, anytime, without paying a dime.</p>
